# Newbie-WebProject
This repository contains a project developed during my first year at university. It's a simple HTML/CSS website showcasing various Apple products, designed to emulate the style of the official Apple website. As part of my coursework, I created this project to demonstrate my understanding of basic web development concepts and design principles.
