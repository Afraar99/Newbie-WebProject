					<p>I am so excited using IPhone 11! Camera, all apps for sending messages, editing photos and other sources, which it has, make my life easier. It seems like I have a personal assistant who regulates the whole my daily routine. Now I am going to buy a Macbook. <br>However, I am confused a little bit, because the variety of models impresses me. But it is just a matter of time. Soon I will be a happy owner of new electronic assistant. What can be better?</p>

					<p>I had a macbook pro 2018 display issue where suddenly yellow spots appeared and it just so happened few days after the 1 year warranty expired, since it was bought from another country where I wanted to fix it... it would've costed. Apple support made an exception in their system that allowed my laptop to be fixed for free in my country.<br> Thanks</p>
