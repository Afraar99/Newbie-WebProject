		<h1>We are the world's largest company</h1>
		<p>Apple, based in Cupertino, CA, is one of the most valuable companies in the world. It produces popular digital gadgets, including Macs, iPods, iPhones, and iPads.<br><br>The company was founded in 1976 by two young hackers, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Its second product, the Apple II, was the first personal computer to achieve mass-market success. The Macintosh, released in 1984, introduced the modern graphical user interface to the mainstream.<br><br>Apple began to struggle after its board ousted Steve Jobs from the company in 1985. When Jobs returned to Apple in 1997, it was close to bankruptcy. Then Jobs led a spectacular recovery, introducing the iPod in 2001, the iPhone in 2007, and the iPad in 2010. The result: Apple earned almost $40 billion in profits in its 2014 fiscal year.<br><br>Jobs died of pancreatic cancer in 2011. Since then, the company has been led by Tim Cook, Jobs's longtime deputy. Apple's success is due in large part to its obsessive focus on the user experience. Apple is a designer-centric company that likes to build all parts of a product — hardware, software, and online services — itself. That approach has allowed Apple to build some of the most elegant and user-friendly products ever created</p>

		<h1>Apple Event<br> (September 14, 2021) <br>Here’s what we announced !</h1>
		<p>In an average year, Apple holds three to four events. There's usually a spring event in March, the Worldwide Developers Conference in June, a September event that's focused on iPhone and Apple Watch, and sometimes an October event if there are iPads or Macs expected in the fall. Apple is developing a fifth-generation iPad Air that will be similar to the sixth-generation iPad mini. It's expected to feature an A15 Bionic chip, 5G connectivity for cellular models, and a 12-megapixel Ultra Wide front camera with Center Stage support. It will look similar to the current iPad Air, offering a single-lens rear camera, a 10.9-inch LCD display, a USB-C port, a Touch ID power button, and various color options. It could come in the first half of the year, perhaps at a spring event. <br>Apple always holds its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, and we're not expecting any deviation from the standard plan in 2022. WWDC often takes place early in the month, and for the last two years, it has been a digital event rather than an in-person event.<br>It's likely that WWDC will continue to be a digital-only event in 2022 due to the ongoing global health crisis. WWDC will see the introduction of iOS 16, iPadOS 16, watchOS 9, tvOS 16, and macOS 13.<br><br> Bloomberg's Mark Gurman has said that after the March event, Apple is planning to introduce additional new Macs around May or June, and WWDC would be the ideal time for these machines to be announced. Possibilities include a new iMac and an introduction of the Apple silicon Mac Pro.</p>
